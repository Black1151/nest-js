# Insight Monorepo

This repository contains both the NestJS backend (`insight-be`) and the Next.js frontend (`insight-fe`).

- `insight-be` – GraphQL API and business logic
- `insight-fe` – user facing application built with Next.js

See [insight-fe/docs/theming.md](insight-fe/docs/theming.md) for an overview of the theming system used by the Lesson Builder.
